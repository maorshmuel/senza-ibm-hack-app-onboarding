The programming language detected is JavaScript, particularly using React library.

Here is the analysis of the presence of specific functions and imports:
- init() function: False
- import statement for senza-sdk: False
- uiReady() function: False
- constructor() function: False (Note: In React functional components, there is no direct equivalent of a constructor. Instead, the component's logic is handled within the function itself or using lifecycle methods like useEffect.)

Given the absence of required elements, here is a report with findings and proposed code changes:

To incorporate the missing elements, we can update the code as follows:

First, we need to add the import statement for senza-sdk. Since we are dealing with a React application, we should ensure that our modifications do not disrupt the existing logic.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, useNavigate, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
import shaka from 'shaka-player';
import { init, uiReady } from "senza-sdk"; // Adding the import statement for senza-sdk

// Rest of the code remains the same
```

Next, we need to add the init() function and uiReady() function. Given that these functions should be executed when the application is ready, we can utilize the load event listener for this purpose. However, in a React context, it's more idiomatic to use the useEffect hook for such initialization tasks.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, useNavigate, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
import shaka from 'shaka-player';
import { init, uiReady } from "senza-sdk";

// List of assets with poster and video URLs from Shaka samples:
const assets = [
  {
    id: 'angel-one',
    title: 'Angel One',
    videoUrl: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-demo-assets/angel-one/dash.mpd',
    posterUrl: 'https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/assets/images/angel-one.jpg'
  },
  {
    id: 'elephants-dream',
    title: 'Elephants Dream',
    videoUrl: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-demo-assets/elephants-dream/dash.mpd',
    posterUrl: 'https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/assets/images/elephants-dream.jpg'
  },
  {
    id: 'big-buck-bunny',
    title: 'Big Buck Bunny',
    videoUrl: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-demo-assets/bbb/dash.mpd',
    posterUrl: 'https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/assets/images/bbb.jpg'
  }
];

// Adding init and uiReady functions inside useEffect
function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function initialize() {
      await init();
      uiReady();
    }
    initialize();
  }, []);

  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/player/:id" element={<Player />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

// Rest of the code (Home and Player components) remains the same

export default App;
```

This modification integrates the required init() and uiReady() functions into the application, ensuring they are called once the application is ready, without disrupting the existing React logic.
